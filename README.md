# RhombixTechnologies_Tasks

This repository contains the projects and tasks completed during my internship at RhombixTechnologies.  
The projects are focused on cybersecurity, Python scripting, and network analysis, demonstrating practical implementations of concepts learned during the internship.



Projects Overview

 Project 1: Network Sniffer
- Implemented a Python-based network sniffer using **Scapy**.
- Captures live packets and analyzes multiple protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP).
- Supports Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) expressions for targeted traffic capture.
- Extracts useful data such as HTTP Host & Path from plaintext traffic.
- Provides detailed logging with verbose mode.

 Project 2: (Upcoming Project)
- [Description will be added here]

 Project 3: (Upcoming Project)
- [Description will be added here]



 Features
- Real-time packet capturing  
- Multi-protocol support (TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP)  
- Lightweight HTTP parser to extract request details  
- Extendable for future security analysis tasks  
- Clean, modular Python code
